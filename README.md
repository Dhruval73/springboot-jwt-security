Spring Boot Security with JWT Authentication

Developed a secure Spring Boot application implementing Spring Security for authentication and authorization. Integrated JWT (JSON Web Token) to manage user authentication, ensuring stateless and scalable access control. The application includes:

User authentication with Spring Security and JWT-based token generation.
Role-based access control to protect endpoints based on user roles.
Secure API endpoints with JWT validation for controlled resource access.
Custom authentication filters to intercept requests and validate tokens.

This project demonstrates best practices in securing REST APIs and handling authentication in a microservices-based architecture.
